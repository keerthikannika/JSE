                                        <p>If these Terms of use and/or any goods and/or services provided under these Terms of use are regulated by the Consumer Protection Act No 68 of 2008, as amended, replaced or re-enacted from time to time (&#8220;Consumer Protection Act&#8221;), it is not intended that any provision of these Terms of use contravenes any provision of the Consumer Protection Act and therefore all provisions of these Terms of use must be treated as being qualified, if necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act are complied with. Nothing in these Terms of use does or purports to limit or exempt the JSE from liability for any loss directly or indirectly attributable to the gross negligence of the JSE or any person acting for or controlled by the JSE where the law does not allow this and this clause also does not require you to assume the risk or liability for this kind of loss where the law does not allow this.</p>
